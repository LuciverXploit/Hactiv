At HackThisSite, we have always tried to be a safe, welcoming place for people from every walk of life. This year we would like you to join us in celebrating LGBTQ+ Pride Month for the month of June. Pride is a reminder that while a lot of progress has been made over the past few decades, the fight is far from over and your help is needed.<br />
<br />
You may wonder <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-pride-an-explanation-for-straight-people_b_5931ccdae4b0649fff2118ee" target="_blank">why people are flying those rainbow flags</a> every year shouting that they are proud. Why do they feel the need to announce it, and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2015/10/5-reasons-why-prides-matter/" target="_blank">why does there need to be a whole month for it</a>? In the perfect world, this would not be necessary.<br />

On June 28, 1969 at the Stonewall Inn in Manhattan, New York, a riot happened. This riot would be the tipping point, starting the path for equality. This was the start of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots" target="_blank">Stonewall Riots</a>, a violent stand against the police criminalizing LGBTQ+ identities.

HackThisSite will be present at the Chaos Computer Congress again this year from December 27 - 30. However, with the ongoing human malware pandemic, CCC will be held entirely remotely and online only as <i>rC3</i>. Therefore, we will be present on both our <a href="ircs://irc.hackthissite.org:7000/#rc3" target="_blank">IRC server (#rc3 channel)</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/khEkhgJ" target="_blank">Discord (#irc-rc3 channel)</a>, as well as the official rC3 communication platforms (when announced).<br />
<br />
Make sure to follow the <a href="https://events.ccc.de" target="_blank">CCC blog</a> and the <a href="https://rc3.world" target="_blank">official rC3 website</a> for more details. The <a href="https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de" target="_blank">schedule of events</a> will soon be posted, and as always, <a href="https://media.ccc.de" target="_blank">talks can be viewed online</a> without a ticket.<br />

See you soon in the virtual world!]]></description>

&quot;Vote as if your life depends on it - because it does!&quot;[/center]<br />
<br />
Those are the famous words of the late and venerable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Dart_Jr." target="_blank">Justin Dart Jr.</a>, co-founder of the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) and &#039;Godfather of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)&#039;. He said this long ago to underscore the importance of electing politicians, at all levels, that will be an ally to those less fortunate. Especially those whose lives literally depend on the outcome of an election.<br />
<br />
<b>All of our lives hinge on the result of this election in November.</b> The current administration and those that side with it seek to inflict as much pain, suffering, and even death on people they disagree with. That is not hyperbole, that is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/08/24/republicanmeltdown-trump-convention-400039" target="_blank">literally their political ideology</a>. From destroying decades of work building civil rights for Black people and LGBTQ+, to empowering and encouraging Nazis and white nationalists, to countless impeachable acts of outright fascism -- and lately...]]></description>

The unjustifiable murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and so many more have inspired uprisings not just in the United States but across the globe. The world is grieving, and we grieve with them. But <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/bryan-stevenson-on-the-frustration-behind-the-george-floyd-protests" target="_blank">the world is also angry</a>, and rightfully so. For far too long, innocent people, especially minorities and persons of color, have been slaughtered by police with utter impunity, and now police are committing outright acts of terrorism against people protesting this injustice, against the press reporting on their heinous actions, and against innocent bystanders and even children that are not participating in any protests. Furthermore, state and federal officials up to and including the White House are using this as an excuse to implement the most egregiously fascist authoritarianism in the US.<br />

This must end <b>now</b>. We must demand justice and accountability and we cannot stop until all police officers, their unions, and police departments are ...]]></description>
